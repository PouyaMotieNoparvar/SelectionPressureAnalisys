# SelectionPressureAnalisys
This repository provides costum scripts (i.e. pseudopipeline) to analysis multiple genes at the same time for selection pressure. \n

There pipeline includes: 
1- retrivial of CDS sequences of orthologue genes, 
2- combining the fasta sequences
3- cleaning and making unique sequences in each fasta file
4- alihnment of sequences using MAFFT
5- converting fasta to phylip3.2
6- Applying pal2nal
7- generating phylogenic trees using RAxML
8- Applying CODEML analysis on the file

You need to install the tools and packages required to run these codes yourself.
